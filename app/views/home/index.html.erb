<h2 class="text-center">Why Are Effective Blogs so Important?</h2>
<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2%;"> <strong>First</strong>, consider the journey of a person discovering your article. If your ideal reader lands on your blog post, where did they find it?

Many people may come through social media, and if you're great at SEO, they'll find your article through search engines. In either case, let's take a look at what they see before clicking over into your article.

Search engine results pages and social media posts both tend to show readers the same few things: The blog title and either your meta description or a snippet of your introduction. You need to have a strong title and meta description to capture the click, but once they're on your post, you have one job: Keep them there.

That's where the blog introduction comes into play.</p>

<article>The Purpose of the Blog Post Introduction</article>
<br>
<p style="text-indent: 2%;">Now that someone has clicked through to your blog post, your job is not done. It's just beginning.

Regardless of whether the traffic to your post has come from a social media post, search, or somewhere else entirely, the prime point of engagement is now the introduction. 

And the introduction's purpose is also singular: sell the read.

Just as your title and meta description must sell the click, the introduction must sell the read. If your introduction is boring, people are going to bounce. They may skim. But, they for sure aren't going to be engaged with your content.

A captivating blog introduction consists of content that intrigues, teases, and maybe even annoys or offends the reader - whatever it takes to make them want to read the rest of the article. 

All the energy must go to making it compelling - compel the reader to read.</p>
